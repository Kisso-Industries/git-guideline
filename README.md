# Git Guideline

> Kisso Industries' Git Commit Message Guidelines

We have rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more**
**readable messages **that are easy to follow when looking through the** project history**.  But also,
it makes it easier to **write automated tools** on top of it like **generating the change log**.
# #Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```none
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.
The **body **and the** footer(s)** are optional.
Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than **80 characters**! This allows the message to be easier to read.
# #Specification


## 1-Type

Must be one of the following:
* **feat**: Add a new feature (equivalent to a _MINOR_ in [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/))
* **fix**: Fix a bug (equivalent to a _PATCH_ in [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/))
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**:  Code style change (white-space, formatting, semi-colons, indentation, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **revert**: The commit reverts a previous commit
* **chore**: Update something without impacting the user (ex: bump a dependency in package.json)
* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)


```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG

```


## 2-Scope

A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis.

```
feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays

```


## 3-Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
* limit to **50 characters**
* use the **imperative, present tense**: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end


```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5

```


## 4-Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
> _Explain what and why vs. how_

```
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.

```


## 5-Footer

A footer’s value _MAY_ contain spaces and newlines, and parsing _MUST_ terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to add a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any. For closing issues you _MUST use the keyword _`fix`

```
fix: correct minor typos in code

see the issue for details on typos fixed.

fix #133

```


## @-Revert

> If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

```
revert: refactor!: drop support for Node 6

This reverts commit 676104e

```


## @-Breaking Changes

> Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, and/or as an entry in the footer.

```
refactor!: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: refactor to use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.

```

> If included as a **footer**, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text `BREAKING CHANGE`, followed by a colon, space, and description

```
refactor: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: refactor to use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.

```

> If included in the **type/scope prefix**, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:` CAN be omitted from the footer section, and in that case the commit **Body** SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.

```
refactor!: drop support for Node 6

Refactor to use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.

```

# #FAQ

**How should I deal with commit messages in the initial development phase?**

We recommend that you proceed as if you’ve already released the product. Typically somebody, even if it’s your fellow software developers, is using your software. They’ll want to know what’s fixed, what breaks etc.


**Are the types in the commit title uppercase or lowercase?**

Any casing may be used, but it’s best to be consistent.


**What do I do if the commit conforms to more than one of the commit types?**

Go back and make multiple commits whenever possible. Part of the benefit of the guideline is its ability to drive us to make more organized commits and PRs.


**Doesn’t this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?**

It discourages moving fast in a disorganized way. It helps you be able to move fast long term across multiple projects with varied contributors.


**Might this guideline lead developers to limit the type of commits they make because they’ll be thinking in the types provided?**

The guideline encourages us to make more of certain types of commits such as fixes. Other than that, the flexibility of the guideline allows your team to come up with their own types and change those types over time.


**How does this relate to SemVer?**

fix type commits should be translated to PATCH releases. feat type commits should be translated to MINOR releases. Commits with BREAKING CHANGE in the commits, regardless of type, should be translated to MAJOR releases.


## What do I do if I accidentally use the wrong commit type?
**When you used a type that’s of the spec but not the correct type, e.g. fix instead of feat**

Prior to merging or releasing the mistake, we recommend using git rebase -i to edit the commit history. After release, the cleanup will be different according to what tools and processes you use.


**When you used a type not of the spec, e.g. feet instead of feat**

In a worst case scenario, it’s not the end of the world if a commit lands that does not meet the conventional commit specification. It simply means that commit will be missed by tools that are based on the spec.
